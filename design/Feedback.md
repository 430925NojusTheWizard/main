### The text for the word "buzzy" is kinda hard to read with the colour that is, When using the zoom fuction the images and names on the home page go out of proportion and lose most of the text. all the links work. The text on the about page looks a bit odd as well i would put a margin on it so it isnt pressed against the web boarder.

### The layout is pretty clean, with neat and consistent presentation of each product. Plenty of information is provided about the products you're selling but you should embed more videos about them. I like the font you've used across the site as well. My only gripe is that the About page is lacking some flair and the text is kind of misaligned.

### It has a sleek modern and well polished design. The colour scheme is overall consistant between pages and I particularly like the hover on the best selling products. It isn't free from issues though as a few things could be polished more or altered, mostly spacing/padding on the products page and the about page. The font on the image of the main page is a bit hard to read due to the colours blending in to the background image. Also, you could probably just remove the basket page link and just keep the button for decal same as the login page as they serve little purpose and lead to dead ends in the case of the login page. The individual phone pages work well but again could use some spacing and rearranging perhaps. Other than that I wouldn't change too much other than just spacing and maybe the font colour on the main page image. 8/10 *thumbs up emoji*

# Feedback Response
+ I've reworked on the text looking off in the "About" section.
+ I would fix the "Phone buzzy" blending in with the background by adjusting the background's light/darkness
+ I would fix the zoom function messing with the images and names on the home page by making them stay in their original form without stretching or bending.
